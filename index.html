		<p><b>Here's some interesting correlations for you!</b>
			<br>			<br>
			
		   - Apparently, states with the highest percentage of people who havent finished highschool have the lowest percentage of married people! Probably just a function of younger people being present, but interesting nonetheless!
			<br>			<br>
			
		
			- Also, it seems that states where people tend to walk or bike to work have the lowest percentage of overweight and obese people! Expected, but still good to know.
